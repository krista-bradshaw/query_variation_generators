This repository houses the culmination of work completed in REIT4841 for the thesis: "Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval Pipelines with Query Variation Generators: A Reproducibility Study". This project delves into the robustness of information retrieval systems when dealing with query variations and explores how different datasets, models, and variation categories influence retrieval pipeline performance and effectiveness. It is a reproduction and expansion of the research conducted by Gustavo Penha, Arthur Cˆamara, and Claudia Hauf.
